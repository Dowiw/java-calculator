# java-calculator

9/1/2025
this java project is following what Mr. Bro Code is doing as well as adding my own tweaks in the future.

this will be a sort of "learn how to" kind of repository just so i can keep track of my progress. :)

i want to take some time to actually understand how different functions work while i mimic the original programmer.
